# Expectation-Variance-Calc
This program calculates the expectation and variance of present value streams for an N-period bond. The user specifies the coupon rate, discount rate, probability of default, number of possible payment periods, and the face value of the bond. The resulting output is the variance and expectation of the present value of the coupon or cash streams.
